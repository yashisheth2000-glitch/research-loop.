SOURCE RULES — these are strict and non-negotiable:

- PREFER, in this order: (1) company filings, annual reports, investor presentations, earnings releases; (2) named business publications with a bylined journalist (Business Standard, Economic Times, Mint, Reuters, Bloomberg); (3) government or regulatory data.

- NEVER cite: LinkedIn posts, Medium posts, personal blogs, PESTEL/SWOT analysis sites, listicles, SEO content farms, HBR case-study summaries republished by third parties, or any page that doesn’t name a specific author or institution.

- If a claim can only be supported by an excluded source, DROP the claim rather than cite a weak source.

- For every claim, prefer a specific number from a primary source over a general statement from a secondary one.

ANSWER RULES:

- Cover all major angles — don’t stop at the first sufficient-looking answer

- Lead with the most recent data available (latest quarter or full year), and name the reporting period

- Name a specific source for every claim, and include a number or data point wherever one exists

- Flag explicitly if two sources contradict each other — never average them into one sentence

- Explain the business implication of each finding, not just the fact

- Write in clear, direct prose{feedback_section}

Research question: {question}

Answer to evaluate:

{answer}

Check for these specific gaps:

1. Are there major angles of this question that weren’t covered?

2. Are there claims made without a named source — publication, institution, company filing, or official report?

3. Does any claim rely on a weak source (LinkedIn post, Medium, personal blog, PESTEL/SWOT site, listicle, unnamed author)? If so, that is an automatic FAIL.

4. Is there a specific number or data point for every key claim, or are claims stated as general facts without evidence?

5. Is the answer using the most recent data available, or is it citing older figures when newer ones exist?

6. If two sources disagree, has that contradiction been named explicitly — or was it averaged into one clean sentence?

7. Is there a named company, market, or India-specific context where relevant — or is the answer too generic to be useful for an Indian business audience?

8. Does the answer explain the business or market implication of each finding — not just the fact itself?

9. Would a domain expert read this and immediately ask “but what about X?”

If the answer passes all seven checks, respond with exactly:

VERDICT: PASS

If any check fails, respond with exactly:
